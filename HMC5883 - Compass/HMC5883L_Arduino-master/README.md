HMC5883L_Arduino
==================

### Description
In this example weâ€™re going to deal with the Compass Module 3-Axis HMC5883L from Parallax and how to integrate it into an Arduino.

The Compass Module 3-Axis HMC5883L is designed for low-field magnetic sensing with a digital interface. This compact sensor fits into small projects such as UAVs and robot navigation systems.

The sensor converts any magnetic field to a differential voltage output on 3 axes. This voltage shift is the raw digital output value, which can then be used to calculate headings or sense magnetic fields coming from different directions. Example code in PBASIC, Spin, and C are provided in the downloads.
